# Team Storytellers of Canada

> _Note:_ This document is intended to be relatively short. Be concise and precise. Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your application and is non-technical. 

## Description 
 * Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective
 * What is the problem you're trying to solve?
 * Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem?

We are planning to build a mobile app that allows storytellers and listeners to share their own stories, respond to other stories with their own story, and listen to the Storytellers of Canada radio station. The stories that users can submit will be voice recordings of up to 3 minutes in length. Our app will allow for more interactivity as they are now able to share their own words, which will hopefully retain listeners and attract new storytellers. It provides a clean and user-friendly interface for users to explore fascinating stories that they would not have had a chance to hear if not for the Storytellers of Canada application.

The problem we are trying to solve is that although they have a radio station set-up, they lack listeners. Their organizational and artist goals include making connections through story, but connections require interactive opportunities that are lacking with the current setup. For example, a storyteller or listener may listen to the Storytellers Radio station but feel disconnected because they cannot share their own story, causing them to disengage from the content. Storytellers of Canada need a platform that allows users to interact with each other and share experiences, and that is what we aim to create.

Our application solves this problem because it creates a way for Storytellers of Canada to reach out to a younger audience that primarily uses mobile applications for consuming content, ultimately increasing the amount of their listeners. Previously, the only online resources that the organization had for telling stories was through their online radio station and a short catalogue of stories on their website. This meant there was no way for users to have on-demand access to the entire library of stories that Storytellers of Canada has to offer. As well, although the organization holds many in-person storytelling events and sells CDs on their website, these are not very appealing to the tech-savvy audience they wish to reach out to, showing a stronger need for the mobile application we developed. As well, by creating a feature that allows listeners to submit their own responses, we have included a level of interactivity never seen before with Storytellers of Canada and this should hopefully retain users and appeal to more potential listeners.

## Key Features
 * Described the key features in the application that the user can access
 * Provide a breakdown or detail for each feature that is most appropriate for your application
 * This section will be used to assess the value of the features built

## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described above
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully
 
 ## Development requirements
 * If a developer were to set this up on their machine or a remote server, what are the technical requirements (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application (think a true README).
 
 ## Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and how
 * Don't forget to **briefly explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

 ## Licenses 

 Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.

 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase?
 * What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
 * Why did you or your partner make this choice?
